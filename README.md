## Tech Stack

**Client**: The web client is a React/Redux application bootstrapped with `create-react-app`

**Data Transport**: We use Apollo as our frontend data store, GraphQL (Dashboard) and Websocket (Game) for data transport

**Server**: Backend server is an Elixir/Phoenix API server

**Database**: Everything is stored in a Postgres database

## Setting up

Before we start, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html), and [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) installed on your machine

Once installed, copy and paste the `.env.example` to `.env` and update your environment keys

Then run:

```bash
make setup
# If you want, you can seed some questions
make seeds
```

## Running the app locally

```bash
# Start the api server
make phx

# In a separate terminal window
make react
```

## Deployment

Any code merged into master will autodeploy through [Render](https://render.com/)
